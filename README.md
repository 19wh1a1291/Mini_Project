Considering the road transport data inclusive of traffic and accidents, the idea of speed control 
is very crucial, it ensures to provide maximum road safety as well as driving ease at traffic with 
the use of technology. In a world where everyone rushes till the nth hour, to give a suggestion 
to control the speed of any vehicle at smart zones like schools, hospitals, etc like this is 
mandatory. This indeed envisions, a future that is accident-free and stresses the importance of 
road safety and rules beyond human errors and false testimony approval. This system is 
designed in such a way that suggested speed is regulated manually and tried to be confined at 
the marked smart zones with the help of the RF module. At smart zones, the RF transmitter is 
placed at two ends of the premises. The RF receiver in the vehicle receives the signal from the 
transmitter when entered into the zone which occurs due to the frequency mis-match. Engine 
Control Unit (ECU) remapping helps in Auto-Suggestions of speed. This happens using manual
speed control when the region is committed to that particular zone. Once the vehicle leaves the 
zone, the driver can control the speed as per the traffic rules.
